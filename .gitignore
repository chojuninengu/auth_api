Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a .gitignore snippet and a suggested edit. The original file has two lines: "/target" and "Cargo.lock". The proposed changes add comments and a slash to the first line.

First, I need to apply the edits. The first line in the original is "/target". The suggestion changes it to "/target/" with a comment. So I replace that line, adding the comment. The second line is "Cargo.lock" which already matches the suggestion, but the comment in the new version says "(now ignored)". Wait, the original second line is just "Cargo.lock" and the new version adds the comment. So I need to add the comment there.

Wait, the user said "apply the suggested edit" to the previous code. The original lines didn't have comments. The suggested code adds comments. So I should rewrite the original lines to include the comments as per the suggestion.

So the first line in the original is "/target" â€“ the edit changes it to "/target/" with a comment. The second line was "Cargo.lock", which the edit leaves the same but adds a comment "Cargo lock file (now ignored)". So I need to take the original target line, change it to /target/ with the comment, then the second line as Cargo.lock with the new comment.

Therefore, the final .gitignore should have:

# Rust build artifacts
/target/

# Cargo lock file (now ignored)
Cargo.lock

No extra lines or explanations. Exactly the lines provided with the edits applied.

# Rust build artifacts
/target/

# Cargo lock file (now ignored)
Cargo.lock
